## ❖・Introduction・❖
For this final project, you’re building a portfolio-themed web site of your school projects, graphic design work, photographs/illustrations, audio compositions, or other creative work. If you don’t have work of your own, you have three options:

1. Use a friend’s, colleague’s, or family member’s work as the basis for your project.
2. Create a portfolio of an artist’s or designer’s work whom you admire. (They can be alive or deceased.)
3. Produce a portfolio for a fictitious person or entity using open source images.

I encourage you to consider both traditional web design elements (navigations on top, 960 pixel widths, etc) and non-traditional elements (navigation elements perhaps on the bottom, non-linear display of content, etc). Experiment!
