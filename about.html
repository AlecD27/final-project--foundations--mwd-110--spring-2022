      <p>My name is Alec Dergachev.</p>
      <p>
        I am currently enrolled in the University of Hartford and majoring in Multimedia and Web Design.
      </p>
      <p>
        As of right now, drawing is just a hobby of mine, something I do on the side when I'm feeling creative.
      </p>
      <p>
        I prefer to draw by hand on paper, but I enjoy finalizing my work by tracing and coloring it digitally, so that the colors are exactly how I want them and so that it's easier to share my work after it's completed.
